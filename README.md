# 📊 Data Analysis Assignment

## 📌 Objective

This assignment demonstrates the use of Python (pandas & matplotlib) to:

- Load and explore a dataset
- Perform basic data analysis
- Create simple visualizations

## 📂 Tasks Completed

### 🔹 Task 1: Load and Explore Dataset
- Loaded the Iris dataset (CSV or from `sklearn.datasets`)
- Displayed first rows using `.head()`
- Checked data structure with `.info()`
- Cleaned missing values using `.dropna()`

### 🔹 Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
- Computed summary statistics using `.describe()`
- Grouped data by species and calculated mean values
- Observed patterns in flower measurements

### 🔹 Task 3: Data Visualization
- Created 4 different plots with matplotlib:
	- **Line chart** – trend of first numeric column
	- **Bar chart** – average measurement per species
	- **Histogram** – distribution of one feature
	- **Scatter plot** – relationship between two features


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Princessglory/wk-7-Python-Ass.git
	```

2. **Install required libraries (if not already):**

	```bash
	pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
	```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

	```bash
	jupyter notebook Assignment.ipynb
	```

4. **Run each cell to see analysis and plots.**

## 📌 Findings

- Each Iris species has unique measurement patterns.
- Setosa flowers are generally smaller, while Virginica flowers are larger.
- Clear separation is visible between petal length and width among species.
